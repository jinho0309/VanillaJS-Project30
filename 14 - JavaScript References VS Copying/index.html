        // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

        // and we want to make a copy of it.

        const team = players; //Reference
        console.log(players,team);
        // You might think we can just do something like this:
        team[3] = 'Lux'; 
        console.log(team); //['Wes','Sarah','Ryan','Lux']
        console.log(players);
        //['Wes','Sarah','Ryan','Lux']
        
        
        // however what happens when we update that array?

        // now here is the problem!

        // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

        // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

        // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice(); //Copy (not Reference)
        
        // one way

        // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);//Copy

        // or use the new ES6 Spread

        const team4 = [...players];//Copy
        
        const team5 = Array.from(players);//Copy
        
        // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

        // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

        // with Objects
        const person = {
            name: 'Wes Bos',
            age: 80
        };

        // and think we make a copy:
        const captain = person;//Reference
        //captain.number = 99;
        
        console.log(person);
        console.log(captain);
        // how do we take a copy instead?

        const cap2 = Object.assign({},person, {number : 99});
        // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

        const cap3 = {...person};
        // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
